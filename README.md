# WATER FALLING DAMAGE #
### An addon for Garry's Mod ###

"Water Falling Damage" is a simple addon that'll damage players that hit the water too fast from a respectable height. This was made for realism purposes since the Source Engine by default neutralizes any falling damage when hitting water, thing that in real life doesn't happen. 

Obviously this isn't meant for gamemodes/servers that rely on fall stopping surfaces like water :v this would break them. 

It has two available server-side admin only options: 

- Toggle the addon 
- Damage multiplier
